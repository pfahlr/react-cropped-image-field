# react-cropped-image-field
react module provides an form input for image uploads that presents the user with a crop tool to position their image within the specified aspect ratio and upon submission converts the image to base64 so it can be stored directly in a database varchar/text field.

## Todo
[ ] - should generate an image with the dimensions provided in the `width` and `height` parameters... not sure why this isn't working... 
[ ] - add zoom and rotate
[ ] - make UI look nice
